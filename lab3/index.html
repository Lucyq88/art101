			<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create an organized file structure, one that is easy to understand and follow as we will be working on it for the rest of the quarter</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I honestly did not find any problems, since we got a templete it made the process so much easier. But usually I do like to keep my files organized!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think the assingment is great to remind us of the importance of having well structure and organized folders and files, it makes our life so much easier, and when it comes to programming/coding it is essential.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Well, this is the result (I did make some changes on css) but pretty much this you are looking at the index.html file I created for Lab 3. Following are all the screenshots I took for thsi lab.</p>
