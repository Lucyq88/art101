		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>We are Isabelle and Lucy! Isabelle is majoring in AGMP, and I'm (Lucy) majoring in Art and Latin American and Latino Studies. Some things about Isabelle *that I just learned* she likes cats, web design, and much more things that I hope to learn this quarter. Some things about me are that I also like cats, I like video games, and I drink a cup of coffe every day!</p>
